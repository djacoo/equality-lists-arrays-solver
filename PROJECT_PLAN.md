### 2.6 Main Solver Integration
- [ ] Implement main solver loop
  1. Check for store symbols → decompose into subproblems
  2. For each subproblem, process select symbols
  3. For each subproblem, check for T_cons symbols
  4. Apply T_cons-procedure or T_E-procedure accordingly
- [ ] Implement result aggregation (SAT if any subproblem is SAT)
- [ ] Test with mixed theory examples
